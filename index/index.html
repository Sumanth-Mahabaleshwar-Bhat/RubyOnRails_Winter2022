				<h3>MY PERSONAL BACKGROUND AND INTERESTS</h3>
				<p class="aboutMe">Quality Education at the primary level becomes a strong foundation in any student’s life. Similarly, the Science and Mathematics subject provided a strong foundation during my primary education. At my pre-university level, I was very much inclined to the electronics subject therefore, I opted to pursue my Bachelor of Engineering degree in Electronics and Communication department from RNS Institute of Technology affiliated to Visvesvaraya Technological University (VTU) Belgaum. Being in one of the top ten institutions in my city I have managed to secure good grades during my undergraduate course.</p>
				<p class="aboutMe">I had developed an interest in programming during my primary education where Java was one of the major subjects in the 10th standard. Gradually I started developing an interest in Embedded Systems and the IoT field, Communication, and other programming languages. This interest motivated me to work harder in the field of electronics due to which I took training in embedded systems that covered both Embedded Systems and programming languages like C/JAVA/Python for a period of almost 1 year. I have participated in all the open house mini-project expos conducted by our departments which showcases the creativity and knowledge about electronic circuits and programming skills during each semester of my undergraduate course. I have won the Best project award many times wherein the judges having industry and research experience evaluated our projects. The inputs and advice provided by the judges during the open house mini-project expo motivated me to research more into the field of Electronics and bring out a quality project each time using the support of my faculties. My final year project titled “Technology Enriched City and Home (T.E.C.H)” was based on the Embedded and IoT field focusing on the implementation of a few features of Smart City and Smart Home. I have published papers on “Traffic Management in Hilly Terrain Areas” in the International Conference on Business Management and Information Technology 2019, National Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering, Science and Technology 2019 which is a problem statement mentioned in the Smart India Hackathon and on “Technology Enriched City and Home (T.E.C.H)” in the International Research Journal of Engineering and Technology. I have completed an internship in Wipro Ltd. under the topic “Digital Business Marketing with Chabot’s and Virtual Assistants” and in Skillfinity under the topic “C Programming and Embedded Systems”. I worked as an Embedded Software Developer at SPACEGRAPH after the completion of my undergraduate course from October 1st 2020 to December 31st 2020 and as an Automation and Functional Test Engineer at Accenture from January 11th 2021 to December 17th 2021.</p>
				<p class="aboutMe">During the study of my undergraduate course, I had made my mind to pursue a Master’s in the field of Electrical and Computer Engineering. I want to gain more knowledge in the field of Electronics and Communication which has interested me a lot for a long period. My long-term goal is to complete the Master’s of Engineering degree successfully and work in a reputed company in the country and help the society through my work with social impact applications in my field of domain and interest. Canada has become an educational hub for pursuing post-graduation for many international students. It is precisely the reason that I selected Canada and the McMaster University in particular as my destination for pursuing higher education. Canada is one of the few countries where the education system tries to understand the true calling of the individual than just judge him on his grades or mark. The Master’s Degree that I wish to pursue is just a means to achieve my ultimate aim of contributing to the larger picture of human civilization.</p>
